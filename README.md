# Joaquim's ChiaBot

A discord bot that monitors your chia farm summary and sends notifications when blocks are found and new plots are completed. It can link multiple farmers/harvesters to your account.

The ChiaBot client is available for Windows, Linux and macOS. You can interact with the bot in [ChiaBot playground](https://discord.gg/aEkYWQGWdS) discord server.

## Installation 
Download this repository, then proceed with the following platform-specific instructions:

#### Windows
1. Open `` install.bat `` as an **administrator**
2. As a regular user, open 
   - `` run.bat `` if you're setting up your farmer (main machine) 
   - `` run_harvester.bat `` if it's a harvester.

#### Ubuntu (16.04+), Debian, Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi and other Debian-based distros
1. Open terminal in project's root directory and then run 
   - `` sh run.sh `` if you're setting up your farmer (main machine) 
   - ``sh run_harvester.sh `` if it's a harvester.

The script will install dart, git, screen and setup the client for you. Do **not run it as root**, it will issue "sudo" and ask for your password when/if necessary.

#### Other amd64/arm64 Linux distros
1. Install dart, git and screen using your distro's package manager
2. Run 
   - `` sh run.sh `` if you're setting up your farmer (main machine)
   - `` sh run_harvester.sh `` if it's a harvester.

If you have trouble running the script try running `` dart pub get`` and `` dart chiabot.dart `` manually.

#### macOS
1. Install [dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
2. Open terminal in project's root directory and then run `` dart pub get ``
3. While in the project's root directory, run:
   - `` dart chiabot.dart `` if you're setting up your farmer (main machine) 
   - ``dart chiabot.dart harvester `` if it's a harvester.
   
### First time
ChiaBot will generate an id for your device. You can link this device to your discord account by heading to [ChiaBot playground](https://discord.gg/aEkYWQGWdS) and sending the following message:
```
!chia link [your-client-id]
```
ChiaBot will save your id in its cache file (``.chiabot_cache.json``), so you only need to run this command once per device.

### Upgrading
To upgrade, download this repository again and replace the previous files. 
If you're on Windows, there's no need to run `` install.bat ``.
You will need to reconfigure ``config.json`` with your chosen settings.
You may keep ``.chiabot_cache.json`` file which stores your device's id so you don't have to link it again.

## Usage
If your device was linked sucessfully, you may use `` !chia `` to see your farm summary, or `` !chia full `` to display additional statistics about it and `` !chia workers `` to show them per farmer/harvester.
To see the full list of commands you can use, type: `` !chia help ``

Please note that on Windows, you **must not close** ``run.bat`` or ``run_harvester.bat`` as doing that will kill the client. If you do so, open it again.

On Linux it is safe to close ``run.sh``, as it runs it in background and reopening will reattach to the client's process.
Press ``ctrl+c`` when you want to close the client. You must reopen ``run.sh`` after restarting your computer.

### Configuration
ChiaBot stores your current configuration in ``config.json``
You do not need to edit this file, as it's automatically generated by ChiaBot. However, you may wish to customize some of its options.
If you wish to do so, you can rename ``config.json.default`` to ``config.json`` to change them.
These are the default settings:
```json
[
    {
        "name": null,
        "showBalance": true,
        "sendBalanceNotifications": true,
        "sendPlotNotifications": false,
        "sendOfflineNotifications": false,
        "parseLogs": false,
        "chiaPath": null
    }
]
```

#### Name your client
You can name your client by changing `` "name": null,`` to ``"name": "YourFarmer",`` (notice **quote marks**). This will identify the client as ``YourFarmer`` in `` !chia workers ``.

#### Sharing XCH Balance
Set ``showBalance`` to ``false`` if you do not want your balance to be reported to the server. Setting this to false will disable Block notifications.

#### Plot Notifications
Set ``sendPlotNotifications`` to ``true`` if you wish to be notified when your farmer/harvester completes a plot.

#### Block Notifications
Set ``sendBalanceNotifications`` to ``false`` if you do not wish to be notified when your farmer finds a block.

#### Offline Notifications
Set ``sendOfflineNotifications`` to ``true`` if you wish to be notified when your farmer/harvester loses connection.

#### Chia Log Parsing
If your chia debug level is set to ``INFO`` ([find how to do that here](https://thechiafarmer.com/2021/04/20/how-to-enable-chia-logs-on-windows/)), setting ``parseLogs`` to ``true`` will enable extra stats, such as number of challenges in the last 24 hours, max, min and average challenge response times and incomplete SubSlots.

You may delete ``config.json`` and ``.chiabot_cache.json`` to reset settings and generate a new id once the client is started again.

### Troubleshooting

##### My farmer/harvester doesn't have plots. Can I still use ChiaBot?
Yes, your client will add itself when chia completes a plot.

If the client crashes:
##### Do ``run.bat`` or ``run_harvester.bat`` close suddenly after being opened?
  Try launching CMD as an administrator and opening ``install.bat`` from there. Then do the same with ``run.bat`` or ``run_harvester.bat``.
##### Is your chia farm running? 
  You can check this by running ` chia farm summary `, if it shows "Status: Farming", then it is.
##### Are your plot drives mounted?
  If they're not, then mount them.
##### Does your user have permission to access the folders where plots are stored?
  ChiaBot will not be able to list your plots if their folder was mounted as root.

##### What if I have two or more farmers?
  Run one of them as a farmer and the others as harvesters.
  
## FAQ

##### Are you going to steal my keys?
No. The only command issued by chiabot client is ``chia farm summary``. It does not use Chia's RCP servers, therefore it doesn't even need your private key.

##### How can I trust you?
This project is open-source, so you don't have to trust me. Read the code yourself :)

##### What data is collected?
You can see the data that's currently tied to your discord ID with ``!chia api``
Your wallet address is not sent to the server so your data remains anonymous (that is, except being linked to your discord ID).

##### What if I don't want my data to be stored in your server anymore?
Simple, stop using it. All data will be deleted 15 minutes after your client sent its last report.
