# ChiaBot

A discord bot that monitors your chia farm summary and sends notifications when blocks are found and new plots are completed. It can link multiple farmers/harvesters to your account.

The ChiaBot client is available for Linux and Windows. You can interact with the bot in [ChiaBot playground](https://discord.gg/aEkYWQGWdS) discord server.

## Installation 
Download this repository, then proceed with the following platform-specific instructions:

#### Windows
1. Open `` install.bat `` as an **administrator**
2. As a regular user, open 
   - `` run.bat `` if you're setting up your farmer (main machine) 
   - `` run_harvester.bat `` if it's a harvester.

#### Ubuntu (16.04+), Debian, Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi and other Debian-based distros
1. Open terminal in project's root directory and then run 
   - `` sh run.sh `` if you're setting up your farmer (main machine) 
   - ``sh run_harvester.sh `` if it's a harvester.
   
The script will install dart, git, screen and setup the client for you. Do **not run it as root**, it will issue "sudo" and ask for your password when/if necessary.

#### Other amd64/arm64 Linux distros
1. Install dart, git and screen using your distro's package manager
2. Run 
   - `` sh run.sh `` if you're setting up your farmer (main machine)
   - `` sh run_harvester.sh `` if it's a harvester.
   
If you have trouble running the script try running `` dart pub get`` and `` dart chiabot.dart `` manually.

### First time
ChiaBot will generate an id for your device. You can link this device to your discord account by heading to [ChiaBot playground](https://discord.gg/aEkYWQGWdS) and sending the following message:
```
!chia link [your-client-id]
```
ChiaBot will save your id, so you only need to run this command once per device.

### Upgrading
To upgrade, download this repository again and replace the previous files. 
If you're on Windows, there's no need to run `` install.bat ``.
Your device will keep its id so you don't have to link it another time.

## Usage
If your device was linked sucessfully, you may use `` !chia `` to see your farm summary, or `` !chia full `` to display additional statistics about it and `` !chia workers `` to show them per farmer/harvester.
To see the full list of commands you can use, type: `` !chia help ``

Please note that on Windows, you **must not close** ``run.bat`` or ``run_harvester.bat`` as doing that will kill the client. If you do so, open it again.

On Linux it is safe to close ``run.sh``, as it runs it in background and reopening will reattach to the client's process.
Press ``ctrl+c`` when you want to close the client. You must reopen ``run.sh`` after restarting your computer.

### Configuration
ChiaBot stores your current configuration in ``config.json``
You do not need to edit this file, as it's automatically generated by ChiaBot. However, you may wish to customize some of its options.
This is how it looks like:
```json
[
    {
        "chiaPath": null,
        "showBalance": true,
        "sendBalanceNotifications": true,
        "sendPlotNotifications": false,
        "sendOfflineNotifications": false,
        "parseLogs": false
    }
]
```

#### Sharing XCH Balance
Set ``showBalance`` to ``false`` if you do not want your balance to be reported to the server.

#### Plot Notifications
Set ``sendPlotNotifications`` to ``true`` if you wish to be notified when your farmer/harvester completes a plot.

#### Block/Balance Notifications
Set ``sendBalanceNotifications`` to ``false`` if you do not wish to be notified when your farmer finds a block.

#### Offline Notifications
Set ``sendOfflineNotifications`` to ``true`` if you wish to be notified when your farmer/harvester loses connection.

#### Chia Log Parsing
If your chia debug level is set to ``INFO``, setting ``parseLogs`` to ``true`` will enable extra stats, such as number of challenges in the last 24 hours, max, min and average challenge response times and incomplete SubSlots.

You may delete ``config.json`` and ``.chiabot_cache.json`` to reset settings and generate a new id once the client is started again.

### Troubleshooting

##### My farmer/harvester doesn't have plots. Can I still use ChiaBot?
Yes, your client will add itself when chia completes a plot.

If the client crashes:
##### Do ``run.bat`` or ``run_harvester.bat`` close suddenly after being opened?
  Try launching CMD as an administrator and opening ``install.bat`` from there. Then do the same with ``run.bat`` or ``run_harvester.bat``.
##### Is your chia farm running? 
  You can check this by running ` chia farm summary `, if it shows "Status: Farming", then it is.
##### Are your plot drives mounted?
  If they're not, then mount them.
##### Does your user have permission to access the folders where plots are stored?
  ChiaBot will not be able to list your plots if their folder was mounted as root.

##### What if I have two farmers?
  Run one of them as a farmer and the other as a harvester.
