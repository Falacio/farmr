# farmr

A web dashboard that allows you to monitor your Chia farm and sends notifications when blocks are found and new plots are completed through a discord bot. It can link multiple farmers/harvesters to your account.

The farmr client collects local stats about your farm and it is available for Windows, Linux and macOS [here](https://github.com/joaquimguimaraes/farmr/releases/latest). 
The dashboard can be found in [farmr.net](https://farmr.net). Alternatively, you can interact with the bot in [Swar's Chia Community](https://discord.gg/q5T4QbwcnH) discord server. You must be in this server to receive notifications.
